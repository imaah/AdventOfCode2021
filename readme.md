# Advent Of Code 2021
On this repository you will find my solution for the 2021 edition of the Advent of Code.

I try to use a different language every day. 

## Languages used :
* day 1 : [APL](day1-apl)
* day 2 : [SQL](day2-sql)
* day 3 : [Scratch](day3-scratch)
* day 4 : [OCaml](day4-ocaml)
* day 5 : [Bash](day5-bash)
* day 6 : [Spreadsheet](day6-spreadsheet) (why not ?)

## Disclaimer âš 
Most of the languages I have used (or will use) for this challenge I have never used before, so my solutions may not be the best.

If you have better solutions, I'd be happy to hear about them!
